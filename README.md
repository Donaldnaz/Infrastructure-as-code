AWS EC2 Instance Deployment using Terraform
This repository contains Terraform configuration files for deploying an AWS EC2 instance with a secure and automated setup.
The goal is to showcase how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources quickly, consistently, and with minimal manual work.

The project provisions:
An EC2 instance (t3.micro)
A Security Group with SSH and HTTP access
Automatic tagging for easy resource tracking
A custom key pair for secure access
All resources are created, managed, and destroyed through Terraform commands.
